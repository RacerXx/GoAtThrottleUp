==============
This is a KSP mission control mod. 
It is designed to give pertinent flight data to either the pilot on a multi-monitor machine, or be used as a multi-player tool with a mission control/pilot setup. 
In a mission control situation, the ideal setup is 2-4 people in “mission control” in another room from the pilot who is running IVA only with no map or UI to help. 
We like to use rasterpropmon in this case to make the cockpit experience more entertaining. 
The mission control people then need to communicate among themselves and then through a comms officer who relays directions to the pilot. 
All of the required data to get a kerbalnaut LARP pilot to the Mun and back is presently presented, more data to help with inter-planetary trips is planned, but probably possible presently if you have a firm grasp of orbital mechanics.


Shout outs to Telemachus and RasterPropMonitor.
